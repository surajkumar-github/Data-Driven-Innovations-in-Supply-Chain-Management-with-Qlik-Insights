# Data-Driven-Innovations-in-Supply-Chain-Management-with-Qlik-Insights
## Project Overview

This project, titled Data Driven Analytics for Supply Chain Management, was part of my internship at SmartInternz. The goal was to derive valuable insights from the DataCo Global dataset using Qlik Insights, focusing on enhancing supply chain management.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is provided by DataCo Global. It includes comprehensive information on various supply chain parameters, such as inventory levels, order quantities, delivery times, and supplier performance.

As the size of the dataset is greater than 25MB, it was unable to upload, therefore i have attached the link to the dataset below.
